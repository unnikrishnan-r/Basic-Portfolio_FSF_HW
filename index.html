                    Computers always fascinated me as a kid, and after having spent more than a decade in the world of
                    custom softwares I still feel like a boy standing at the seashore picking pebbles. That speaks
                    volumes
                    about the endless possibility
                    technology and specifically software opens up for the betterment of daily life for each one of us.
                    That
                    is what motivated me to set out in exploration to the world of web development!!!

                    My career so far has revolved around the famous Mainframes! Right out of college, my first job was
                    as a
                    COBOL/DB2 developer and there has been no looking back since.
                    In 11 years, I have built numerous Mainframe based applications using COBOL and CICS, with DB2 or
                    IMS on
                    the backend.
                    When you buy groceries, it is very likely that you are invoking a piece of code that has my name on
                    it,
                    because my clients were primarily the household names of retail industry.
                    I have also worked with integration tools like TIBCO, and have my fair share of exposure to
                    messaging
                    frameworks, webservices, REST APIs etc.

                    Outside of work, I am a sports enthusiast (just to watch ;)) and a foodie. I love going on road
                    trips,
                    and even after 2 toddlers I have not given that up.
